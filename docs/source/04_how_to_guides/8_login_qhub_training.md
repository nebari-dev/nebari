# How to log in on QHub (training)

This guide aims to explain to newcomers how to log in to Quansight's own QHub Training server (for training sessions). 
Your own organization's QHub is likely to have a different procedure.

To access the training platform, you will need to:
1. Register on [https://training.qhub.dev](https://training.qhub.dev).

3. Next, you should then receive an email from **Quansight-training** with a 6-digit code (remember to check your spam folder, just in case).
