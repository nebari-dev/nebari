# Minikube

[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) is a project allowing you to run a local Kubernetes node simulation for
development and testing purposes.

It's possible to run QHub on Minikube, and this can allow quicker feedback loops for development, as well as being less
expensive than running cloud Kubernetes clusters.

Local testing is a great way to test the components of QHub. It's important to highlight that while it's possible to
test most of QHub with this version, components that are Cloud provisioned such as VPCs, managed Kubernetes cluster and
managed container registries can't be locally tested, due to their Cloud dependencies.

## Compatibility

Currently, **QHub local deployment is primarily compatible with Linux-based Operating Systems**. The main limitation for
the installation on MacOS relates to
[Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#known-limitations-use-cases-and-workarounds)
being unable to route traffic to containers. Theoretically, the installation of HyperKit Driver could solve the issue,
although the proposed solution isn't tested. There some workarounds for running
[Minikube on Mac below](#minikube-on-mac).

This guide assumes that you have the QHub repository downloaded, and you are at the root of the repository.

## Dependencies

> NOTE: The following instructions apply **only to Linux OS**.

To deploy QHub locally requires the installation of the following dependencies:

- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) version 1.10.0-beta and up
- [Docker Engine driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) install.

The installation of a hypervisor isn't necessary.

> NOTE: Minikube requires `kubectl` OR you can use the embedded kubectl appropriate for your Minikube cluster version
> using `minikube kubectl`. To install `kubectl` [follow the instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
> according to your operating system.

## Initialize Kubernetes cluster

Before proceeding with the initialization, make sure to add yourself to the Docker group by executing the command
`sudo usermod -aG docker <username> && newgrp docker`.

Testing is done with Minikube. To confirm successful installation of both Docker and Minikube, you can run the following
command to start up a local Kubernetes cluster:

```shell
minikube start --cpus 2 --memory 4096 --driver=docker
```

The command downloads a Docker image of around 500Mb in size and initialise a cluster with 2 CPUs and 4 GB of RAM, with
Docker as the chosen driver.

Once `minikube start` finishes, run the command below to select the status of the cluster:

```bash
minikube status
```

If your cluster is running, the output from minikube status should be similar to:

```bash
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
timeToStop: Nonexistent
```

After you have confirmed that Minikube is working, you can either continue to use, or you can stop your cluster. To stop
your cluster, run:

```bash
minikube stop
```

Next, the user installs `nfs-common` drivers. This is required by the JupyterLab instances, which require NFS mount for
`PersistentVolumeClaims` (PVCs). To install it, run:

```shell
minikube ssh "sudo apt update; sudo apt install nfs-common -y"
```

For more details on PVs and PVCs, read the
[JupyterHub documentation](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jupyterhub/customizing/user-storage.html).

## Optional pre-pulling and caching of Docker images

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand note</summary>

### Why pre-pull Docker images

As part of deployment, Minikube downloads Docker images that have a combined size of several Gigabytes. Each time
minikube is destroyed and created it re-pulls these images. Also, Terraform times out on slower internet connections if
it takes longer than 10 minutes to pull the images.

Images can be pre-pulled and added to the Minikube cache. This greatly reduce the time required for future deployments
and reduces the data requiring download during deployment.

### Pre-pulling and caching

The following assumes that docker is currently installed.

The first step is to configure the minikube home directory environment variable. To set this to the home directory of
the current user, run:

```bash
export MINIKUBE_HOME=$HOME/.minikube
```

The current list of Docker images is visible in the `qhub-config.yaml` file under the `default_images` key. Each image
is pulled.

```bash
docker pull quansight/qhub-jupyterhub:v0.x.x
docker pull quansight/qhub-jupyterlab:v0.x.x
docker pull quansight/qhub-dask-worker:v0.x.x
docker pull quansight/qhub-dask-gateway:v0.x.x
```

Replacing `v0.x.x` with the current version that's listed. Note this may take several minutes. Once the process is
complete, the user can copy them to the Minikube cache.

```bash
minikube image load quansight/qhub-jupyterhub:v0.x.x
minikube image load quansight/qhub-jupyterlab:v0.x.x
minikube image load quansight/qhub-dask-worker:v0.x.x
minikube image load quansight/qhub-dask-gateway:v0.x.x
```

Again, adding the correct version. With this completed local Minikube deployment no longer requires pulling the
preceding docker images.

The preceding process is repeated with the updated tags when a new version of QHub is deployed.

## MetalLB

[MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) is the load balancer for bare-metal Kubernetes clusters. The user needs to
configure MetalLB to match the QHub configuration.

## Automation of MetalLB with Python script

*Skip to next section for configuration without Python*

Minikube doesn't provide a simple interactive way to configure addons,
([as shown in this repository issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/8283)). It's recommended to set load
balancer start/stop IP address using a Python script with pre-established values. This recommendation is due to an
existing DNS name that uses some addresses.

To do so, paste
[this Python script](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/blob/main/tests/scripts/minikube-loadbalancer-ip.py) in a text
file named `minikube-loadbalancer-ip.py` and then run:

```shell
python minikube-loadbalancer-ip.py
```

### Manually configure MetalLB

*Skip this section if the preceding Python script is used*

First the user needs to obtain the Docker image ID:

```shell
$ docker ps --format "{{.Names}} {{.ID}}"
minikube <image-id>
```

Copy the output image id and use it in the following command to obtain the Docker interface subnet CIDR range:

```shell
$ docker inspect --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}/{{.IPPrefixLen}}{{end}}' <image-id>
```

A example subnet range looks like `192.168.49.2/24`. This CIDR range has a starting IP of `192.168.49.0` and ending
address of `192.168.49.255`. The `metallb` load balancer is provided a range of IP addresses contained in the Docker
CIDR range. If your CIDR is different, you can determine your range IP addresses from a CIDR address at
[this website](https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr).

For this example case, the user assigns `metallb` a start IP address of `192.168.49.100` and an end of `192.168.49.150`.

The user can enable `metallb` as shown below. The command-line tool interface prompts the user for the start and stop IP
range:

```shell
minikube addons configure metallb
-- Enter Load Balancer Start IP: 192.168.49.100
-- Enter Load Balancer End IP: 192.168.49.150
```

If successful, the output should be `âœ…  metallb was successfully configured`.

### Enable MetalLB

After configuration enable MetalLB by running

```shell
minikube addons enable metallb
```

The output should be `The 'metallb' addon is enabled`.

## Note for development on Windows Subsystem for Linux 2

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand note</summary>

The browser can have trouble reaching the load balancer running on WSL2. A workaround is to port forward the proxy-pod
to the host IP 0.0.0.0. Get the ip address of the WSL2 machine via `ip a`, which should be a 127.x.x.x address. To
change the port forwarding after opening `k9s` you can type `:pods <enter>`, hover over the proxy-... pod and type
`<shift-s>`, and enter the IP addresses.

</details>

## Deploy QHub

To deploy QHub handle setup dependencies and create a new sub-directory by running:

```bash
pip install -e .
mkdir -p data
cd data
```

## Initialize configuration

Then, initialize the configuration file `qhub-config.yaml` with:

```shell
python -m qhub init local --project=thisisatest  --domain github-actions.qhub.dev --auth-provider=password --terraform-state=local
```

## Deploy and render the infrastructure

Next, the user renders the infrastructure files from `qhub-config.yaml` running.

```shell
python -m qhub deploy --config qhub-config.yaml --disable-prompt
```

To ease development, the DNS record `github-actions.qhub.dev` is pointed to `192.168.49.100` so the next step is
optional unless you end up with the load-balancer giving you a different IP address.

Make sure to point the DNS domain `github-actions.qhub.dev` to `192.168.49.100` from the previous commands. This is done
in many ways, the easiest one is by modifying `/etc/hosts` and adding the line below. The command overrides any DNS
server.

```ini
192.168.49.100 github-actions.qhub.dev
```

## Verify the local deployment

Finally, if everything is set properly you should be able to `cURL` the JupyterHub Server. Run

```bash
curl -k https://github-actions.qhub.dev/hub/login
```

It's also possible to visit `https://github-actions.qhub.dev` in your web browser to select the deployment.

Since this is a local deployment, hence it's not visible to the internet; `https` certificates isn't signed by
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Thus, the certificates is
[self-signed by Traefik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate).

Several browsers makes it difficult to view a self-signed certificate that's not added to the certificate registry.

Each web browser handles this differently. A workaround for Firefox:

- Visit `about:config` and change the `network.stricttransportsecurity.preloadlist` to `false`

And a workaround for Chrome:

- Type `badidea` or `thisisunsafe` while viewing the rendered page (this has to do with
  [how Chrome preloads some domains for its HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://hstspreload.org/) list in a way that
  can't be manually removed)

## Cleanup

To delete all the QHub resources run the `destroy` command. Note that this won't delete your `qhub-config.yaml` and
related rendered files thus a re-deployment via `deploy` is possible afterwards.

```shell
python -m qhub destroy --config qhub-config.yaml
```

To delete the Minikube Kubernetes cluster run the following command:

```shell
minikube delete
```

The command deletes all instances of QHub, cleaning up the deployment environment.

# Minikube on Mac

At one point developing with Minikube on a Mac worked, unfortunately this appears to no longer be the case. A few
differences exists between how Minikube is deployed on Mac versus Linux and if you're interested to try the instructions
as they appeared when this worked, open the collapsed tab below:

<details>
<summary>Previous instructions</summary>

The earlier instructions for Minikube on Linux _nearly_ works on Mac except things that break without clever use of port
forwarding at the right times.

1 - When working out the IP addresses to configure metallb try this:

```
docker ps --format "{{.Names}} {{.ID}}"
docker inspect --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}/{{.IPPrefixLen}}{{end}}' <ID of minikube from previous cmd>
```

This displays something like `192.168.49.2/24`, in which case a suitable IP range would be on the same subnet, for
example start IP 192.168.49.100, end IP 192.168.49.150.

2 - This load balancer won't actually work, so you need to port-forward directly to the JupyterHub service:

```
minikube kubectl -- --namespace=dev port-forward svc/proxy-public 8000:80
```

Then you could access QHub on http://127.0.0.1:8000/

3 - However, the `qhub deploy` step needs to communicate with the Keycloak server, but this isn't possible without the
correct hostname.

It might be possible to set `/etc/hosts` to include `github-actions.qhub.dev` as they are done for the AWS minikube,
below. And meanwhile use kubectl port-forward to actually forward the traffic (from port 443 to something similar?). But
you'd have to start that forwarding at the right point in the deployment. (When Kubernetes is ready, but before
terraform runs the Keycloak operator...)

</details>

# Minikube on AWS

It's possible to run Minikube on AWS (and probably the other clouds). This is useful where you don't have enough memory
to run QHub in a local Minikube cluster on your laptop, or if you are using Mac or Windows and struggling to get
Minikube to work.

Please understand that running Minikube on an AWS EC2 instance isn't the same as 'proper' deployment of QHub to AWS EKS
(Kubernetes service). You might prefer Minikube on AWS over full AWS EKS deployment for testing purposes if you find
Minikube easier to debug, cheaper to run, or if you want to replicate the Minikube setup directly - for example, if
trying to fix the automated Cypress tests which use Minikube within a GitHub actions workflow.

There are some tricks that can make allow Minikube on AWS to feel much like local Minikube for development.

The instructions below should work for Mac.

## Set up AWS credentials

Set your environment variables for your AWS account:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=quansight
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-west-2"
```

This assumes you have a 'quansight' profile in your ~/.aws/config and credentials files, but instead you can set
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` directly.

## Create a Key Pair

You can use a Key Pair that's already registered with AWS, or create one as follows:

```bash
export MYKEYNAME=aws-quansight-<mykey>

aws ec2 create-key-pair \
    --key-name ${MYKEYNAME} \
    --query "KeyMaterial" \
    --output text > ~/.ssh/${MYKEYNAME}.pem

chmod 400 ~/.ssh/${MYKEYNAME}.pem
```

## Run the EC2 instance

The recommended image is an Ubuntu 20.04 with Docker installed. It's recommended to be to run on a 16 GB/4 Core image,
and increase the EBS disk space to 48 GB or so, up from the standard 8 GB.

```bash
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0cd5fb602c264fbd6 --instance-type t3a.xlarge --count 1 --key-name ${MYKEYNAME} --block-device-mappings 'DeviceName=/dev/sda1,Ebs={VolumeSize=48}'
```

Once running, get the instance ID and public DNS:

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].{InstanceId:InstanceId,Host:PublicDnsName}"
```

This should show all instances, so work out which one you need if there are multiple.

## Open SSH port access

Using the instance ID you obtained just preceding (for example `i-01bd8a4ee6016e1fe`), use that to first query for the
'security GroupSet ID' (for example `sg-96f73feb`).

Then use that to open up port 22 for the security group (and hence for the instance). Multiple instances running in this
security group, all of which are now exposed on Port 22.

```bash
aws ec2 describe-instance-attribute --instance-id i-01bd8a4ee6016e1fe --attribute groupSet

aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-96f73feb --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

## SSH into the instance

Using the Public DNS obtained a couple of steps back, you can now SSH into the instance:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/${MYKEYNAME}.pem ubuntu@ec2-18-130-21-222.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

## Install Minikube etc

Install Minikube and Kubectl:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/download/v1.22.0/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.19.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x kubectl

sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu && newgrp docker
```

Obtain QHub repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Quansight/qhub
```

Set up Minikube - very similar to setup for local Minikube:

```bash
minikube start --cpus 4 --memory 12288 --driver=docker
minikube ssh "sudo apt update; sudo apt install nfs-common -y"

python3 ./qhub/tests/scripts/minikube-loadbalancer-ip.py

minikube addons enable metallb
```

## Initialize and deploy QHub

Install Virtualenv and Pip:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-virtualenv -y
sudo apt install python3-pip -y
```

Create and activate a virtualenv, install QHub dev:

```bash
cd qhub
virtualenv ./data-venv
. ./data-venv/bin/activate

pip3 install -e .[dev]
```

Create and modify qhub-config.yaml:

```bash
mkdir data-test
cd data-test

export QHUB_GH_BRANCH=main
qhub init local --project=thisisatest  --domain github-actions.qhub.dev --auth-provider=password

sed -i -E 's/(cpu_guarantee):\s+[0-9\.]+/\1: 1/g' "qhub-config.yaml"
sed -i -E 's/(mem_guarantee):\s+[A-Za-z0-9\.]+/\1: 1G/g' "qhub-config.yaml"
```

The preceding two commands reduce slightly the memory and CPU requirements of JupyterLab sessions etc. Make any other
changes needed to the `qhub-config.yaml` file.

Then deploy:

```bash
qhub deploy --config qhub-config.yaml --disable-prompt
```

## Enable Kubernetes access from Mac

This step is optional, but allows you to use `kubectl` and `k9s` directly from your Mac. It's not needed if you are
satisfied to use kubectl within an SSH session on AWS instead.

On your Mac laptop:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir .minikube_remote
```

Copy these files from the remote instance (home folder):

- .minikube/ca.crt to .minikube_remote/ca.crt
- .minikube/profiles/minikube/client.crt to .minikube_remote/client.crt
- .minikube/profiles/minikube/client.key to .minikube_remote/client.key

For example:

```bash
cd .minikube_remote
scp -i ~/.ssh/${MYKEYNAME}.pem ubuntu@ec2-35-177-109-173.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/.minikube/ca.crt .
scp -i ~/.ssh/${MYKEYNAME}.pem ubuntu@ec2-35-177-109-173.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/.minikube/profiles/minikube/client.crt .
scp -i ~/.ssh/${MYKEYNAME}.pem ubuntu@ec2-35-177-109-173.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/.minikube/profiles/minikube/client.key .
```

Merge the following into your ~/.kube/config file, or just run the command in full to overwrite it:

```bash
cat <<EOF > ~/.kube/config
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority: ../.minikube_remote/ca.crt
    server: https://127.0.0.1:8443
  name: minikube
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: minikube
    user: minikube
  name: minikube
current-context: minikube
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: minikube
  user:
    client-certificate: ../.minikube_remote/client.crt
    client-key: ../.minikube_remote/client.key
EOF
```

Now SSH into the AWS instance, enabling port forwarding so you can access the Minikube cluster as though It's running on
your Mac:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/${MYKEYNAME}.pem ubuntu@ec2-18-130-21-222.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com -L 127.0.0.1:8443:192.168.49.2:8443
```

You should now find that `kubectl` and `k9` work for the Minikube cluster if you run them on your Mac. This can include
`kubectl port-forward` to access Kubernetes services individually.

## Access the full QHub website

However, the way Traefik works won't allow you to port forward to that since it won't see the right domain name and
port.

The users can trick it by setting up a hostname alias. Run `sudo vi /etc/hosts` on the Mac and add:

```bash
127.0.0.1 github-actions.qhub.dev
```

And then the users can add an extra port forward when they SSH into their AWS instance.

```bash
sudo ssh -i ~/.ssh/${MYKEYNAME}.pem ubuntu@ec2-35-177-109-173.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com -L 127.0.0.1:8443:192.168.49.2:8443 -L github-actions.qhub.dev:443:192.168.49.100:443
```

This is executed with the `sudo` privileges because forwarding a low-numbered port, like 443, is not allowed otherwise.

Now you can access https://github-actions.qhub.dev/ in a browser and you should be able to use your QHub. You have to
bypass the self-signed cert warnings though - see [verify the local deployment](#verify-the-local-deployment) for
instructions.
