# In Browser VSCode

Code Sever is a packaging of VS Code in the browser. Within QHub we
have packaged Code Server such that ever user's jupyterlab has a full
featured code editor. This editor will have access to all the same
files that your regular jupyterlab session has access to. To launch
`Code Server` click on the `VS Code IDE` icon within the jupyterlab
launcher seen below.

A new tab will be opened with VS Code and access to all your files. VS
Code state will be saved between sessions so feel free to add
extensions etc. that will enhance your experience.
