# In Browser VSCode

Code Server is a packaging of VS Code in the browser. Within QHub we
have packaged Code Server such that every user's JupyterLab has a full
featured code editor. This editor will have access to all the same
files that your regular JupyterLab session has access to. To launch
`Code Server` click on the `VS Code IDE` icon from the Launcher screen, see below.

A new VS Code tab will be opened, and from here you can still access
all the files. The VS Code state will be saved between sessions so feel free to add extensions, plugins, etc. to enhance your user-experience.
