# QHub Installation

## Pre-requisites

* QHub is supported on the macOS and Linux operating systems.
  > NOTE: **Currently, QHub cannot be installed on Windows**.
* We recommend the adoption of virtual environments (`conda`, `pipenv` or `venv`) for successful usage. 

## Install QHub CLI

QHub's installation can be performed by using:

 * `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge qhub
```
  
 * or `pip` (instead):

```bash
pip install qhub
```  

Once finished, you can check QHub's version (and additional CLI args)
by typing:

```bash
qhub --help
```

If successful, the CLI output will be similar to the following:

```bash
usage: qhub [-h] [-v] {deploy,destroy,render,init,validate,destroy} ...

QHub command line

positional arguments:
  {deploy,destroy,render,init,validate,destroy}
                        QHub - ||QHUB_VERSION||

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         QHub version
```
