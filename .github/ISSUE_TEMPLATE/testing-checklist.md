# Testing Checklist

*Use/modify this checklist as a more comprehensive list of core services to validate before cutting a major release.*

## Test core services

If the integration tests for all of the cloud providers are successful, that is a good sign!
However, the following core services still need to be manually validated (until we can automate them).

At minimum, the following services will need to be tested:
- [ ] Log into keycloak as root user and add a user
- [ ] Log into conda-store and create
  - [ ] a conda environment in a shared namespace and,
  - [ ] a conda environment in your personal namespace
- [ ] Launch dask-gateway cluster, test auto-scaler and
  - [ ] validate that the dask-labextention is working
- [ ] Create a basic CDS Dashboard
- [ ] Open VS-Code extension and create a python file
