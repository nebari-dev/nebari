# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support only the latest version, and we use [CalVer](https://calver.org/) for versioning.

You should feel comfortable upgrading if you're using our documented public APIs and pay attention to `DeprecationWarnings`. Whenever there is a need to break compatibility, it is announced in the [Changelog](https://www.nebari.dev/docs/references/RELEASE) and will raise a `DeprecationWarning` before it's finally really broken.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, please report it at [nebari/security](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/security/new). Please do not report security vulnerabilities on our public issue tracker. Exposing vulnerabilities publicly without giving maintainers a chance to release a fix puts users at risk.
