## Upcoming Release


## Release 2023.10.1 - October 20, 2023

This release includes a major refactor which introduces a Pluggy-based extension mechanism which allow developers to build new stages. This is the initial implementation
of the extension mechanism and we expect the interface to be refined overtime. If you're interested in developing your own stage plugin, please refer to [our documentation](https://www.nebari.dev/docs/how-tos/nebari-extension-system#developing-an-extension). When you're ready to upgrade, please download this version from either PyPI or Conda-Forge and run the `nebari upgrade -c nebari-config.yaml`
command and follow the instructions

> WARNING: CDS Dashboards was removed in this release and upgrading to this version will result in CDS Dashboards being uninstalled. A replacement dashboarding solution is currently in the works
> and will be integrated soon.

> WARNING: Given the scope of changes in this release, we highly recommend backing up your system before upgrading. Please refer to our [Manual Backup](https://www.nebari.dev/docs/how-tos/manual-backup) documentation for more details.

### Feature changes and enhancements

* Extension Mechanism Implementation in [PR 1833](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1833)
  * This also includes much stricter schema validation.
* JupyterHub upgraded to 3.1 in [PR 1856](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1856)'

### Breaking Changes

* While we have tried our best to avoid breaking changes when introducing the extension mechanism, the scope of the changes is too large for us to confidently say there won't be breaking changes.

> WARNING: CDS Dashboards was removed in this release and upgrading to this version will result in CDS Dashboards being uninstalled. A replacement dashboarding solution is currently in the work and will be integrated soon.

> WARNING: We will be removing and ending support for ClearML, Prefect and kbatch in the next release. The kbatch has been functionally replaced by Argo-Jupyter-Scheduler. We have seen little interest in ClearML and Prefect in recent years, and removing makes sense at this point. However if you wish to continue using them with Nebari we encourage you to [write your own Nebari extension](https://www.nebari.dev/docs/how-tos/nebari-extension-system#developing-an-extension).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/compare/2023.7.2...2023.10.1


## Release 2023.7.2 - August 3, 2023

This is a hot-fix release that resolves an issue whereby users in the `analyst` group are unable to launch their JupyterLab server because the name of the viewer-specific `ARGO_TOKEN` was mislabeled; see [PR 1881](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1881) for more details.

### What's Changed
* Fix argo-viewer service account reference by @iameskild in https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1881
* Add release notes for 2023.7.2, update release notes for 2023.7.1 by @iameskild in https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1886


## Release 2023.7.1 - July 21, 2023

> WARNING: CDS Dashboards will be deprecated soon. Nebari `2023.7.1` will be the last release with support for CDS Dashboards integration. A new dashboard sharing mechanism added in the near future, but some releases in the interim will not have dashboard sharing capabilities..

> WARNING: For those running on AWS, upgrading from previous versions to `2023.7.1` requires a [backup](https://www.nebari.dev/docs/how-tos/manual-backup). Due to changes made to the VPC (See [issue 1884](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/issues/1884) for details), Terraform thinks it needs to destroy and reprovision a new VPC which causes the entire cluster to be destroyed and rebuilt.

### Feature changes and enhancements

* Addition of Nebari-Workflow-Controller in [PR 1741](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1741)
* Addition of Argo-Jupyter-Scheduler in [PR 1832](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1832)
* Make most of the API private

### Breaking Changes

* As mentioned in the above WARNING, clusters running on AWS should perform a [manual backup](https://www.nebari.dev/docs/how-tos/manual-backup) before running the upgrade to the latest version as changes to the AWS VPC will cause the cluster to be destroyed and redeployed.

### Release 2023.5.1 - May 5, 2023

### Feature changes and enhancements

* Upgrade Argo-Workflows to version 3.4.4

### Breaking Changes

* The Argo-Workflows version upgrade will result in a breaking change if the existing Kubernetes CRDs are not deleted (see the NOTE below for more details).
* There is a minor breaking change for the Nebari CLI version shorthand, previously it `nebari -v` and now to align with Python convention, it will be `nebari -V`.

> NOTE: After installing the Nebari version `2023.5.1`, please run `nebari upgrade -c nebari-config.yaml` to upgrade
> the `nebari-config.yaml`. This command will also prompt you to delete a few Kubernetes resources (specifically
> the Argo-Workflows CRDS and service accounts) before you can upgrade.

## Release 2023.4.1 - April 12, 2023

> NOTE: Nebari requires Kubernetes version 1.23 and Digital Ocean now requires new clusters to run Kubernetes version 1.24. This means that if you are currently running on Digital Ocean, you should be fine but deploying on a new cluster on Digital Ocean is not possible until we upgrade Kubernetes version (see [issue 1622](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/issues/1622) for more details).


### Feature changes and enhancements

* Upgrades and improvements to conda-store including a new user-interface and greater administrator capabilities.
* Idle-culler settings can now be configured directly from the `nebari-config.yaml`.

## Release 2022.10.1 - October 28, 2022

### **WARNING**

> The project has recently been renamed from QHub to Nebari. If your deployment is is still managed by `qhub`, performing an inplace upgrade will **IRREVOCABLY BREAK** your deployment. This will cause you to lose any data stored on the platform, including but not limited to, NFS (filesystem) data, conda-store environments, Keycloak users and groups, etc. Please [backup](https://www.nebari.dev/docs/how-tos/manual-backup) your data before attempting an upgrade.


### Feature changes and enhancements

We are happy to announce the first official release of Nebari (formly QHub)! This release lays the groundwork for many exciting new features and improvements to come.

This release introduces several important changes which include:
- a major project name change from QHub to Nebari - [PR 1508](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1508)
- a switch from the SemVer to CalVer versioning format - [PR 1501](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1501)
- a new, Typer-based CLI for improved user experience - [PR 1443](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/pull/1443) + [PR 1519](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1519)

Although breaking changes are never fun, the Nebari development team believes these changes are important for the immediate and future success of the project. If you experience any issues or have any questions about these changes, feel free to open an [issue on our Github repo](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/issues).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/compare/v0.4.1...v0.4.3


## Release v0.4.2 - June 8, 2022

### Incident postmortem

#### Bitnami update breaks post v0.4.0 releases

On June 2, 2022, GitHub user @peytondmurray reported [issue 1306](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/issues/1306), stating that he was unable to deploy QHub using either the latest release `v0.4.1` or installing `qhub` from `main`. As verified by @peytondmurray and others, during your first `qhub deploy`, the deployment halts and complains about two invalid Helm charts missing from the bitnami `index.yaml`.

[Bitnami's decision to update how long they keep old Helm charts in their index for](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/10539) has essentially broken all post `v0.4.0` versions of QHub.

This is a severe bug that will affect any new user who tries to install and deploy QHub with any version less than `v0.4.2` and greater than or equal to `v0.4.0`.

Given the impact and severity of this bug, the team has decided to quickly cut a hotfix.

#### AWS deployment failing due to old auto-scaler helm chart

On May 27, 2022, GitHub user @tylerpotts reported [issue 1302](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/issues/1302), stating that he was unable to deploy QHub using the latest release `v0.4.1` (or installing `qhub` from `main`). As described in the original issue, the deployment failed complaining about the deprecated `v1beta` Kubernetes API. This led to the discovery that we were using an outdated `cluster_autoscaler` helm chart.

The solution is to update from `v1beta` to `v1` Kubernetes API for the appropriate resources and update the reference to the `cluster_autoscaler` helm chart.

Given the impact and severity of this bug, the team has decided to quickly cut a hotfix.

### Bug fixes

This release is a hotfix for the issue summarized in the following:
* [issue 1319](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/issues/1319)
* [issue 1306](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/issues/1306)

## Release v0.4.0 - March 17, 2022

**WARNING**
> If you're looking for a stable version of QHub, please consider `v0.3.14`. The `v0.4.0` has many breaking changes and has rough edges that will be resolved in upcoming point releases.

We are happy to announce the release of `v0.4.0`! This release lays the groundwork for many exciting new features and improvements in the future, stay tuned.

Version `v0.4.0` introduced many design changes along with a handful of user-facing changes that require some justification. Unfortunately as a result of these changes, QHub
instances that are upgraded from previous version to `v0.4.0` will irrevocably break.

Until we have a fully functioning backup mechanism, anyone looking to upgrade is highly encouraged to backup their data, see the
[upgrade docs](https://docs.qhub.dev/en/latest/source/admin_guide/breaking-upgrade.html) and more specifically, the
[backup docs](https://docs.qhub.dev/en/latest/source/admin_guide/backup.html).

These design changes were considered important enough that the development team felt they were warranted. Below we try to highlight a few of the largest changes
and provide justification for them.

- Replace Terraforms resource targeting with staged Terraform deployments.
  - *Justification*: using Terraform resource targeting was never an ideal way of handing off outputs from stage to the next and Terraform explicitly warns its users that it's only
    intended to be used "for exceptional situations such as recovering from errors or mistakes".
- Fully remove `cookiecutter` as a templating mechanism.
  - *Justification*: Although `cookiecutter` has its benefits, we were becoming overly reliant on it as a means of rendering various scripts needed for the deployment. Reading through
    Terraform scripts with scattered `cookiecutter` statements was increasing troublesome and a bit intimidating. Our IDEs are also much happier about this change.
- Removing users and groups from the `qhub-config.yaml` and replacing user management with Keycloak.
  - *Justification*: Up until now, any change to QHub deployment needed to be made in the `qhub-config.yaml` which had the benefit of centralizing any configuration. However it
    also potentially limited the kinds of user management tasks while also causing the `qhub-config.yaml` to balloon in size. Another benefit of removing users and groups from the
    `qhub-config.yaml` that deserves highlighting is that user management no longer requires a full redeployment.

Although breaking changes are never fun, we hope the reasons outlined above are encouraging signs that we are working on building a better, more stable, more flexible product. If you
experience any issues or have any questions about these changes, feel free to open an [issue on our Github repo](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/issues).

### Breaking changes

Explicit user facing changes:

- Upgrading to `v0.4.0` will require a filesystem backup given the scope and size of the current change set.
  - Running `qhub upgrade` will produce an updated `qhub-config.yaml` and a JSON file of users that can then be imported into Keycloak.
- With the addition of Keycloak, QHub will no longer support `security.authentication.type = custom`.
  - No more users and groups in the `qhub-config.yaml`.

### Feature changes and enhancements

- Authentication is now managed by Keycloak.
- QHub Helm extension mechanism added.
- Allow JupyterHub overrides in the `qhub-config.yaml`.
- `qhub support` CLI option to save Kubernetes logs.
- Updates `conda-store` UI.

- Adds support for Azure cloud provider.

### Bug fixes

### Breaking changes

- Terraform version is now pinned to specific version
- `domain` attributed in `qhub-config.yaml` is now the url for the cluster

### Migration guide

0. Version `<version>` is in format `X.Y.Z`
1. Create release branch `release-<version>` based off `main`
2. Ensure full functionality of QHub this involves at a minimum ensuring

- \[ \] GCP, AWS, DO, and local deployment
- \[ \] "Let's Encrypt" successfully provisioned
- \[ \] Dask Gateway functions properly on each
- \[ \] JupyterLab functions properly on each

3. Increment the version number in `qhub/VERSION` in format `X.Y.Z`
4. Ensure that the version number in `qhub/VERSION` is used in pinning QHub in the github actions `qhub/template/{{ cookiecutter.repo_directory }}/.github/workflows/qhub-ops.yaml`
   in format `X.Y.Z`
5. Create a git tag pointing to the release branch once fully tested and version numbers are incremented `v<version>`
