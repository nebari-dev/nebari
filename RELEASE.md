### Migration guide

0. Version `<version>` is in format `X.Y.Z`
1. Create release branch `release-<version>` based off `main`
2. Ensure full functionality of QHub this involves at a minimum
   ensuring
  - [ ] GCP, AWS, DO, and local deployment
  - [ ] "Let's Encrypt" successfully provisioned
  - [ ] Dask Gateway functions properly on each
  - [ ] JupyterLab functions properly on each
3. Increment the version number in `qhub/VERSION` in format `X.Y.Z`
4. Ensure that the version number in `qhub/VERSION` is used in pinning
   QHub in the github actions `qhub/template/{{
   cookiecutter.repo_directory }}/.github/workflows/qhub-ops.yaml` in
   format `X.Y.Z`
5. Create a git tag pointing to the release branch once fully tested
   and version numbers are incremented `v<version>`
