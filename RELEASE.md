### Bug fixes

## Release v0.4.0 - March 17, 2022

**WARNING**
> If you're looking for a stable version of QHub, please consider `v0.3.14`. The `v0.4.0` has many breaking changes and has rough edges that will be resolved in upcoming point releases.

We are happy to annouce the release of `v0.4.0`! This release lays the groundwork for many exciting new features and improvements in the future, stay tuned.

Version `v0.4.0` introduced many design changes along with a handful of user-facing changes that require some justification. Unfortunately as a result of these changes, QHub
instances that are upgraded from previous version to `v0.4.0` will irrevocably break.

Until we have a fully functioning backup mechanism, anyone looking to upgrade is highly encouraged to backup their data, see the
[upgrade docs](https://docs.qhub.dev/en/latest/source/admin_guide/breaking-upgrade.html) and more specifically, the
[backup docs](https://docs.qhub.dev/en/latest/source/admin_guide/backup.html).

These design changes were considered important enough that the development team felt they were warranted. Below we try to highlight a few of the largest changes
and provide justification for them.

- Replace Terraforms resource targeting with staged Terraform deployments.
  - *Justification*: using Terraform resource targeting was never an ideal way of handing off outputs from stage to the next and Terraform explicitly warns its users that it's only
    intended to be used "for exceptional situations such as recovering from errors or mistakes".
- Fully remove `cookiecutter` as a templating mechanism.
  - *Justification*: Although `cookiecutter` has its benefits, we were becoming overly reliant on it as a means of rendering various scripts needed for the deployment. Reading through
    Terraform scripts with scattered `cookiecutter` statements was increasing troublesome and a bit intimidating. Our IDEs are also much happier about this change.
- Removing users and groups from the `qhub-config.yaml` and replacing user management with Keycloak.
  - *Justification*: Up until now, any change to QHub deployment needed to be made in the `qhub-config.yaml` which had the benefit of centralizing any configuration. However it
    also potentially limited the kinds of user management tasks while also causing the `qhub-config.yaml` to balloon in size. Another benefit of removing users and groups from the
    `qhub-config.yaml` that deserves highlighting is that user management no longer requires a full redeployment.

Although breaking changes are never fun, we hope the reasons outlined above are encouraging signs that we are working on building a better, more stable, more flexible product. If you
experience any issues or have any questions about these changes, feel free to open an [issue on our Github repo](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/issues).

## Breaking changes

Explicit user facing changes:

- Upgrading to `v0.4.0` will require a filesystem backup given the scope and size of the current change set.
  - Running `qhub upgrade` will produce an updated `qhub-config.yaml` and a JSON file of users that can then be imported into Keycloak.
- With the addition of Keycloak, QHub will no longer support `security.authentication.type = custom`.
  - No more users and groups in the `qhub-config.yaml`.

## Feature changes and enhancements

- Authentication is now managed by Keycloak.
- QHub Helm extension mechanism added.
- Allow JupyterHub overrides in the `qhub-config.yaml`.
- `qhub support` CLI option to save Kubernetes logs.
- Updates `conda-store` UI.

0. Version `<version>` is in format `X.Y.Z`
1. Create release branch `release-<version>` based off `main`
2. Ensure full functionality of QHub this involves at a minimum ensuring

- \[ \] GCP, AWS, DO, and local deployment
- \[ \] "Let's Encrypt" successfully provisioned
- \[ \] Dask Gateway functions properly on each
- \[ \] JupyterLab functions properly on each

3. Increment the version number in `qhub/VERSION` in format `X.Y.Z`
4. Ensure that the version number in `qhub/VERSION` is used in pinning QHub in the github actions `qhub/template/{{ cookiecutter.repo_directory }}/.github/workflows/qhub-ops.yaml`
   in format `X.Y.Z`
5. Create a git tag pointing to the release branch once fully tested and version numbers are incremented `v<version>`
