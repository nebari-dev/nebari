## Upcoming Release

### Feature changes and enhancements

## Release 2022.10.1 - October 28, 2022

### **WARNING**

> The project has recently been renamed from QHub to Nebari. If your deployment is is still managed by `qhub`, performing an inplace upgrade will **IRREVOCABLY BREAK** your deployment. This will cause you to lose any data stored on the platform, including but not limited to, NFS (filesystem) data, conda-store environments, Keycloak users and groups, etc. Please [backup](https://www.nebari.dev/docs/how-tos/manual-backup) your data before attempting an upgrade.


### Feature changes and enhancements

We are happy to announce the first official release of Nebari (formly QHub)! This release lays the groundwork for many exciting new features and improvements to come.

This release introduces several important changes which include:
- a major project name change from QHub to Nebari - [PR 1508](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1508)
- a switch from the SemVer to CalVer versioning format - [PR 1501](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1501)
- a new, Typer-based CLI for improved user experience - [PR 1443](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/pull/1443) + [PR 1519](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/1519)

Although breaking changes are never fun, the Nebari development team believes these changes are important for the immediate and future success of the project. If you experience any issues or have any questions about these changes, feel free to open an [issue on our Github repo](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/issues).

If you are upgrading from a version of Nebari prior to `0.4.5`, you will need to manually update your conda-store namespaces
to be compatible with the new Nebari version. This is a one-time migration step that will need to be performed after upgrading to continue using the service. Refer to [How to migrate base conda-store namespaces](https://deploy-preview-178--nebari-docs.netlify.app/troubleshooting#conda-store-compatibility-migration-steps-when-upgrading-to-045) for further instructions.

## Release v0.4.2 - June 8, 2022

### Incident postmortem

#### Bitnami update breaks post v0.4.0 releases

On June 2, 2022, GitHub user @peytondmurray reported [issue 1306](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/issues/1306), stating that he was unable to deploy QHub using either the latest release `v0.4.1` or installing `qhub` from `main`. As verified by @peytondmurray and others, during your first `qhub deploy`, the deployment halts and complains about two invalid Helm charts missing from the bitnami `index.yaml`.

[Bitnami's decision to update how long they keep old Helm charts in their index for](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/issues/10539) has essentially broken all post `v0.4.0` versions of QHub.

This is a severe bug that will affect any new user who tries to install and deploy QHub with any version less than `v0.4.2` and greater than or equal to `v0.4.0`.

Given the impact and severity of this bug, the team has decided to quickly cut a hotfix.

#### AWS deployment failing due to old auto-scaler helm chart

On May 27, 2022, GitHub user @tylerpotts reported [issue 1302](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/issues/1302), stating that he was unable to deploy QHub using the latest release `v0.4.1` (or installing `qhub` from `main`). As described in the original issue, the deployment failed complaining about the deprecated `v1beta` Kubernetes API. This led to the discovery that we were using an outdated `cluster_autoscaler` helm chart.

The solution is to update from `v1beta` to `v1` Kubernetes API for the appropriate resources and update the reference to the `cluster_autoscaler` helm chart.

Given the impact and severity of this bug, the team has decided to quickly cut a hotfix.

### Bug fixes

This release is a hotfix for the issue summarized in the following:
* [issue 1319](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/issues/1319)
* [issue 1306](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/issues/1306)

## Release v0.4.0 - March 17, 2022

**WARNING**
> If you're looking for a stable version of QHub, please consider `v0.3.14`. The `v0.4.0` has many breaking changes and has rough edges that will be resolved in upcoming point releases.

We are happy to announce the release of `v0.4.0`! This release lays the groundwork for many exciting new features and improvements in the future, stay tuned.

Version `v0.4.0` introduced many design changes along with a handful of user-facing changes that require some justification. Unfortunately as a result of these changes, QHub
instances that are upgraded from previous version to `v0.4.0` will irrevocably break.

Until we have a fully functioning backup mechanism, anyone looking to upgrade is highly encouraged to backup their data, see the
[upgrade docs](https://docs.qhub.dev/en/latest/source/admin_guide/breaking-upgrade.html) and more specifically, the
[backup docs](https://docs.qhub.dev/en/latest/source/admin_guide/backup.html).

These design changes were considered important enough that the development team felt they were warranted. Below we try to highlight a few of the largest changes
and provide justification for them.

- Replace Terraforms resource targeting with staged Terraform deployments.
  - *Justification*: using Terraform resource targeting was never an ideal way of handing off outputs from stage to the next and Terraform explicitly warns its users that it's only
    intended to be used "for exceptional situations such as recovering from errors or mistakes".
- Fully remove `cookiecutter` as a templating mechanism.
  - *Justification*: Although `cookiecutter` has its benefits, we were becoming overly reliant on it as a means of rendering various scripts needed for the deployment. Reading through
    Terraform scripts with scattered `cookiecutter` statements was increasing troublesome and a bit intimidating. Our IDEs are also much happier about this change.
- Removing users and groups from the `qhub-config.yaml` and replacing user management with Keycloak.
  - *Justification*: Up until now, any change to QHub deployment needed to be made in the `qhub-config.yaml` which had the benefit of centralizing any configuration. However it
    also potentially limited the kinds of user management tasks while also causing the `qhub-config.yaml` to balloon in size. Another benefit of removing users and groups from the
    `qhub-config.yaml` that deserves highlighting is that user management no longer requires a full redeployment.

Although breaking changes are never fun, we hope the reasons outlined above are encouraging signs that we are working on building a better, more stable, more flexible product. If you
experience any issues or have any questions about these changes, feel free to open an [issue on our Github repo](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/issues).

### Breaking changes

Explicit user facing changes:

- Upgrading to `v0.4.0` will require a filesystem backup given the scope and size of the current change set.
  - Running `qhub upgrade` will produce an updated `qhub-config.yaml` and a JSON file of users that can then be imported into Keycloak.
- With the addition of Keycloak, QHub will no longer support `security.authentication.type = custom`.
  - No more users and groups in the `qhub-config.yaml`.

### Feature changes and enhancements

- Authentication is now managed by Keycloak.
- QHub Helm extension mechanism added.
- Allow JupyterHub overrides in the `qhub-config.yaml`.
- `qhub support` CLI option to save Kubernetes logs.
- Updates `conda-store` UI.

### Migration guide

0. Version `<version>` is in format `X.Y.Z`
1. Create release branch `release-<version>` based off `main`
2. Ensure full functionality of QHub this involves at a minimum ensuring

- \[ \] GCP, AWS, DO, and local deployment
- \[ \] "Let's Encrypt" successfully provisioned
- \[ \] Dask Gateway functions properly on each
- \[ \] JupyterLab functions properly on each

3. Increment the version number in `qhub/VERSION` in format `X.Y.Z`
4. Ensure that the version number in `qhub/VERSION` is used in pinning QHub in the github actions `qhub/template/{{ cookiecutter.repo_directory }}/.github/workflows/qhub-ops.yaml`
   in format `X.Y.Z`
5. Create a git tag pointing to the release branch once fully tested and version numbers are incremented `v<version>`
